# README â€“ Karaâ€™s Research Archive

**Version:** July 29, 2025  
**Format:** Scientific, Physiological, Evidence-Based  
**Purpose:** This archive contains biological data, environmental documentation, timestamps, and protocol outcomes related to electromagnetic exposure, toxicology, nervous system modulation, and cellular health recovery.

## System Integrity
- Language: Technical and physiological. No symbolic or subjective interpretations.
- Focus: Nervous system response, environmental toxicology, photobiology, elemental metabolism, and electromagnetic interference.
- Methodology: Self-tracking of symptoms, exposures, and outcomes under defined and repeatable conditions.
- Documentation: All data cross-referenced with photographic evidence, timestamps, and submission logs (March 13â€“14, 2025).
